          <p>Being the first designer on a product team wouldn’t be new to me. Most of my experience has been with companies just getting started: establishing dynamic design systems and style guides, and paving the way for semantic, modular code.</p>
          
          <hr />
          
          <h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
          
          <h3 id="youre-cool">You're Cool</h3>
          <p>When my friends say something about an organization, I listen—and everyone I know who works at The Iron Yard is saying great things. From having a sense of transparency within the organization, to allowing your employees autonomy, and having everyone on the team feel unified towards a common goal.. I’m getting a lot of good vibes.</p>
          
          <h3 id="im-cool">I'm Cool</h3>
          <p>You should get a lot of good vibes from me, too! I've worked with four people that are already part of The Iron Yard team, so you'll have a bunch of first-hand accounts about what it's like to work with me.</p>
          
          <h2 id="full-process-design">Full-Process Design</h2>
          <p>I am a generalist. I really enjoy being the first designer on a product, and love being able to contribute to the overall design vision through my abilities. I also really love <a href="https://medium.com/@alejandraluaces/we-don-t-need-more-negativity-bfaaaeb81073">standing behind</a> the benefit of having a wide skillset.</p>
          
          <p>I read an article recently called the <a href="http://fullprocessdesigner.com/">Full-Process Designer</a>. I very much identify with it.</p>
          
          <hr />
          
          <h2 id="values">Values</h2>
          
          <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
          <p>I think it's safe to say we share a lot of the same values.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Men are born soft and supple; dead they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry… whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail."</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I have what I think of as being an "amateur's mindset". I learn something new every day, and welcome new knowledge. Committing to the journey of learning is the key to vitality. As Austin Kleon says,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Being an amateur harnesses the Zen notion of “beginner’s mind” — a state of openness to possibility that closes up as we get calcified in expertise.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I believe an expert's mentality makes you inflexible; resistant to new knowledge or new ways of thinking.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, since I work so closely with clients and have an apprentice of my own, I am always trying to improve the way I teach, sometimes through reading TIY-recommended readings like Make it Stick.</p>
          
          <h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
          <p>This is a follow-up to my values regarding education. The software community is made up of smart, hard-working individuals. When people of various skill levels collaborate, amazing things happen, and everyone comes away a winner.</p>
          
          <h3 id="design">Design</h3>
          <p>When I'm working with a client, I keep things as low-fidelity as I can, for as long as I can. That way, we can allow the voice, tone, and visual style to evolve naturally before committing too much time to higher-fidelity assets.</p>
          
          <p>When you have a stable, cohesive message, visual design naturally follows.</p>
          
          <h3 id="gifs">Gifs</h3>
          
          <p>If you've read this far, awesome! You shall be rewarded with a gif.</p>
