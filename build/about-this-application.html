          <p>I styled this application to resemble a program syllabus. It serves as my cover letter and resume, but also a narrative (elaboration also serves as an educational tool).</p>
          
          <p>One common theme in public-facing code school syllabi is visual inconsistency. Many of the sites are unique: created and styled by individual instructors. As such, the brand voice and tone can become lost. What I’ve made here addresses some of that: having The Iron Yard prominently displayed as the first focal point &amp; using brand colors and styling makes the interface instantly recognizable!</p>
          
          <p>Another issue I’ve recognized is that these documents (some even hosted solely on GitHub, not a publicly accessible URL) are made by developers, styled in a way other developers can  understand. We easily forget that these students are not yet developers! I was not always a developer and it’s taken years of practice and effort to think like one. This gives me a great deal of empathy for, and understanding of, your client base.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, since I work so closely with clients and have an apprentice of my own, I am always trying to improve the way I teach, sometimes through reading The Iron Yard recommended readings like Make it Stick.</p>
