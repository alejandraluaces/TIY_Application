### Naming Conventions

I name things how I've found they most make sense, using a combination of BEM & SMACSS conventions.

### Organization

I use [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/about.html) principles to guide the way I organize my project.

### Deploy

Using [Puma](http://puma.io/) to serve files, and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) to host them. I used [this article](http://jordanelver.co.uk/blog/2014/02/17/how-i-deployed-middleman-to-heroku/) to figure it all out.
