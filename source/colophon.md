## Middleman

### Build
This site was created with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) static site generator.

HAML and SCSS were used, with Markdown for most pages.

I used flexbox for the layout of this page, because flexbox is seriously awesome. Most modern browsers are supported.

Another cool thing I used was clip-path to 'cut out' my image in the bio module on the first page. It's just an alternative to using a transparent .png to achieve the shape, like TIY does on its homepage.

#### Naming Conventions

I name things how I've found they most make sense, using a combination of BEM & SMACSS conventions.

#### Organization

I use [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/about.html) principles to guide the way I organize my project.

### Deploy
Using [Puma](http://puma.io/) to serve files, and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) to host them. I used [this article](http://jordanelver.co.uk/blog/2014/02/17/how-i-deployed-middleman-to-heroku/) to figure it all out.

## Styles

Fonts I used were those I found on The Iron Yard website; Tisa Pro and Open Sans. I tried to follow The Iron Yard's branding as closely as possible.
