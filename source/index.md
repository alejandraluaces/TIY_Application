## About this application

I styled this application to serve as a cover letter, resume, and a narrative, rolled into a format that resembles a program syllabus.

One common theme in code schools' public-facing onboarding/syllabus sites is visual inconsistency.

Many of the sites are unique: created and styled by individual instructors. As such, the brand voice and tone becomes lost.

What I’ve made here addresses some of that: having The Iron Yard prominently displayed as the first focal point, complete with brand colors and styling I took from your marketing site. This would make TIY teachers lives [much easier](/life-easier.html).

Another issue I’ve recognized is that these documents (some even hosted solely on GitHub which isn't always easily accessible) are made by developers, styled in a way other developers can understand. We easily forget that these students are not yet developers!

I was not always a developer and it’s taken years of practice and effort to think like one. This gives me a great deal of empathy for, and understanding of, your client base.
