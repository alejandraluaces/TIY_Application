# About this application

<img src="/images/project-sketch.jpg">
Hello there! Thanks for taking the time to look over my application for the role of UI Designer at The Iron Yard.

I styled this application to serve as a cover letter, resume, and a narrative, rolled into a format that resembles a program syllabus. I wanted to make an Iron Yard branded syllabus-style site to demonstrate how awesome something like this could be for both students and instructors alike!
