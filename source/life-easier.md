# Making Life Easier

From creating lesson plans to managing the educational needs of their students to practicing self-care on their off-time, The Iron Yard teachers have a lot on their plate.

## The tools they need

### One template to rule them all
One way to make life easier is to provide a boilerplate for teachers' public-facing onboarding and syllabus sites.

Consider these two existing repos:

    Could someone recognize that both these documents come from The Iron Yard?

Having a TIY-branded template for teachers to use would be awesome! Not only would it help to keep TIY's brand prominent and consistent throughout all teacher's syllabi, it would also take a lot of that extra work off their plate!

### A home for all your styles
A dynamic pattern library is a tool that wouldn't only benefit your instructors. Developers on the product team, and even marketing and sales departments, could also benefit from having design assets and patterns live in one place.

Instructors could have a library where they can pull code for a module they need and plug it into wherever they're working&#8212;giving them the power to customize their layout while staying within brand guidelines.
