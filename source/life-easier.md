# Making Life Easier

From creating lesson plans to managing the educational needs of their students to practicing self-care on their off-time, The Iron Yard teachers have a lot on their plate.

## The tools they need

One way to make life easier is to provide a boilerplate for teachers' public-facing onboarding and syllabus sites.

Consider these two existing repos:

Having a TIY-branded template for teachers to use would be awesome! Not only would it help to keep TIY's brand prominent and consistent throughout all teacher's syllabi, it would also take a lot of that extra work off their plate!
