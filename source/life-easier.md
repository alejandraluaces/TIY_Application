# Making Life Easier

Many public-facing onboarding/syllabi documents/sites are visually inconsistent. In one organization, most instructors' sites are unique: created and styled by the individual. As such, the overarching brand voice and tone becomes lost.

From creating lesson plans to managing the educational needs of their students to practicing self-care on their off-time, The Iron Yard teachers have a lot on their plate.

## One template to rule them all
Consider these two existing public-facing documents, created by TIY instructors:

  <img src="/images/onboarding-compare.png" alt="Compare these two different onboarding pages.">

    Could someone recognize that both these documents come from The Iron Yard?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Having a TIY-branded template for instructors to use would not only help to keep TIY's brand prominent and consistent throughout all syllabi, it would also free up instructors' time.

## A home for all your styles
A dynamic pattern library is a tool that wouldn't only benefit your instructors. Developers on the product team, and even marketing and sales departments, could also benefit from having design assets and patterns live in one place.

Instructors could have a library of assets they can use to support their lesson plans&#8212;giving them the power to customize their layout while staying within brand guidelines.
