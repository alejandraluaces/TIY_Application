# Making Learning Easier

There are so many ways to make learning easier. We can include repeatable modules to point out extra resources or key points to help recall.

<div class='module--key'>
  <header>
    <div class='module--key__heading'>did you know?</div>
  </header>
  <div class='module--key__paragraph'>Recalling information is one of the keys to learning! Provide teachers the ability to remind students of <strong>key items</strong> throughout their curriculum by providing them with a pattern library! That way, they can pull code for the module and plug it into wherever they're working&#8212;giving them the power to customize their layout while staying within brand guidelines. </div>
