# Making Learning Easier

An issue I’ve recognized is that these documents (some even hosted solely on GitHub which isn't always easily accessible) are made by developers, styled in a way other developers can understand. We easily forget most students aren't quite developers yet! I was not always a developer and it’s taken years of practice and continued effort to think like one. This gives me a great deal of empathy for, and understanding of, the students you serve.

## Small changes matter
There are so many ways to make learning easier, as evidenced by the many resources available for perusal! Sometimes the smallest changes can make a big impact.

We can include repeatable modules to point out extra resources or key points to help recall. Providing teachers with the ability to remind students of *key items* throughout their curriculum is just one small way to improve students' learning experience.

<div class='module--key'>
  <header>
    <div class='module--key__masthead'>did you know?</div>
  </header>
  <div class='module--key__paragraph'>Designing modular code in reusable pattern format</div>
</div>

## Been there, done that
I'm a career changer. I started off in a very analog field&#8212;zookeeping&#8212;where notes were taken on printouts shoved inside a dirty folders. Through hard work and motivation, I was able to teach myself enough skills to get hired at my first software job, and eventually become an experienced and successful product designer.

I didn't do it alone, of course. I was brought on as an apprentice and was expected to learn most of the curriculum myself.

### Empathy
Having experienced learning in the same way many of your students are, I have a great deal of empathy for them and can put myself in their shoes.

### Resources
This also frees up resources. Because of my unique background and experiences, my design assumptions are likely to be accurate enough for me to have some level of autonomy, helping me build and fail faster.

## A Passion for learning

Since education is already a focal point of my work and extracurricular routine, I am constantly reading about it and honing my teaching skills.
