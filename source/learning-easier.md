# Making Learning Easier
There are so many ways to make learning easier. We can include repeatable modules to point out extra resources or key points to help recall.

<div class='module--key'>
  <header>
    <div class='module--key__heading'>did you know?</div>
  </header>
  <div class='module--key__paragraph'>Recalling information is one of the keys to learning! Provide teachers the ability to remind students of <strong>key items</strong> throughout their curriculum by providing them with a pattern library! That way, they can pull code for the module and plug it into wherever they're working&#8212;giving them the power to customize their layout while staying within brand guidelines. </div>

## Been there, done that
I'm a career changer. I started off in a very analog field&#8212;zookeeping&#8212;where notes were taken on printouts shoved inside a dirty folders. Through hard work and motivation, I was able to teach myself enough skills to get hired at my first software job, and eventually become an experienced and successful product designer.

I didn't do it alone, of course. I was brought on as an apprentice and was expected to learn most of the curriculum myself.

### Empathy
Having experienced learning in the same way many of your students are, I have a great deal of empathy for them and can put myself in their shoes.

### Resources
This also frees up resources. Because of my unique background and experiences, my design assumptions are likely to be accurate enough for me to have some level of autonomy, helping me build and fail faster.

## A Passion for learning

Since education is already a focal point of my work and extracurricular routine, I am constantly reading about it and honing my teaching skills.
