# Alejandra + TIY = <3

Being the first designer on a product team wouldn’t be new to me. Most of my experience has been with companies just getting started: establishing dynamic design systems and style guides, and paving the way for semantic, modular code.

###You're Cool
When my friends say something about an organization, I listen&#8212;and everyone I know who works at The Iron Yard is saying great things. From having a sense of transparency within the organization, to allowing your employees autonomy, and having everyone on the team feel unified towards a common goal.. I’m getting a lot of good vibes.

###I'm Cool
You should get a lot of good vibes from me, too! I've worked with four people that are already part of The Iron Yard team, so you'll have a bunch of first-hand accounts about what it's like to work with me.

##Full-Process Design
I am a generalist. I really enjoy being the first designer on a product, and love being able to contribute to the overall design vision through my abilities. I also really love [standing behind](https://medium.com/@alejandraluaces/we-don-t-need-more-negativity-bfaaaeb81073) the benefit of having a wide skillset.

I read an article recently called the [Full-Process Designer](http://fullprocessdesigner.com/). I very much identify with it.

##Values

### Education
I think it's safe to say we share a lot of the same values.

> "Men are born soft and supple; dead they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry... whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail."

I have what I think of as being an "amateur's mindset". I learn something new every day, and welcome new knowledge. Committing to the journey of learning is the key to vitality. As Austin Kleon says,

> Being an amateur harnesses the Zen notion of “beginner’s mind” — a state of openness to possibility that closes up as we get calcified in expertise.

I believe an expert's mentality makes you inflexible; resistant to new knowledge or new ways of thinking.

Additionally, since I work so closely with clients and have an apprentice of my own, I am always trying to improve the way I teach, sometimes through reading TIY-recommended readings like Make it Stick.

### Collaboration
This is a follow-up to my values regarding education. The software community is made up of smart, hard-working individuals. When people of various skill levels collaborate, amazing things happen, and everyone comes away a winner.

### Design
When I'm working with a client, I keep things as low-fidelity as I can, for as long as I can. That way, we can allow the voice, tone, and visual style to evolve naturally before committing too much time to higher-fidelity assets.

When you have a stable, cohesive message, visual design naturally follows.
