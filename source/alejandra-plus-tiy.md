# Alejandra + TIY

Most of my experience has been with companies just getting started; establishing dynamic design systems and style guides, and paving the way for semantic, modular code.

Being the first designer on your product team would be a natural fit.

##Reputation

### You're Cool
When my friends say something about an organization, I listen&#8212;and I've been hearing a lot of great things about The Iron Yard.

### I'm Cool
You should get a lot of good vibes from me, too! I'm resourceful and dedicated. I value humility before intelligence. I love collaborating, though I would describe myself as being a supermotivated self-starter.

Don't take it from me, though: I've worked with a few awesome people that are already part of The Iron Yard team, so you'll have a bunch of first-hand accounts about what it's *really* like to work with me.

##Full-Process Design
I am a generalist. I really enjoy being the first designer on a product, and love being able to give a brand a voice through my abilities. I recently read an article called [Full-Process Designer](http://fullprocessdesigner.com/). I very much identify with it.

A generalist is awesome when you're just starting to build a design team, working autonomously and sourcing specialized help when needed.

##Values
I think it's safe to say we share a lot of the same values:

### Education
> "Whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail."

I have what I think of as being an "amateur's mindset". I learn something new every day, and welcome new knowledge. Committing to the journey of learning is the key to vitality. An expert's mentality makes you inflexible; resistant to new knowledge or new ways of thinking.

As Austin Kleon says,

> Being an amateur harnesses the Zen notion of “beginner’s mind” — a state of openness to possibility that closes up as we get calcified in expertise.

Additionally, since I work so closely with clients and have an apprentice of my own, I am always trying to improve the way I teach, sometimes through reading TIY-recommended readings like Make it Stick.

### Collaboration
This is a follow-up to my values regarding education. The software community is made up of smart, hard-working individuals. When people of various skill levels collaborate, amazing things happen, and everyone comes away a winner.

### Community
It's important for me to be a [positive force](https://medium.com/@alejandraluaces/we-don-t-need-more-negativity-bfaaaeb81073) in our community. I love The Iron Yard's inclusive, collaborative mentality, and that a core part of the curriculum is based around nurturing and leveraging community.

### Design
When I'm working with a client, I keep things as low-fidelity as I can, for as long as I can. That way, we can allow the voice, tone, and visual style to evolve naturally before committing too much time to higher-fidelity assets.

It's important to establish a design foundation first: defining a strong, consistent message, and clear objectives. Visual design naturally follows.

### Gifs

If you've read this far, awesome! You shall be rewarded with a gif.

I know gifs are important to The Iron Yard, so I'll have you know that I have a `reaction gifs` folder on my desktop, full of giffy goodness. Pronounced with a hard `g`.
