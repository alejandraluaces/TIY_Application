Being the first designer on a product team wouldn’t be new to me. Most of my experience has been with companies just getting started: establishing dynamic design systems and style guides, and paving the way for semantic, modular code.

###Reputation

When my friends say something about an organization, I listen– and everyone I know who works at The Iron Yard is saying great things. From having a sense of transparency within the organization, to allowing your employees autonomy, and having everyone on the team feel unified towards a common goal.. I’m getting a lot of good vibes.

###Values

Education is something near and dear to my heart. I was a really bad student in high school, so since then, I’ve been really analyzing and thinking the impact different methods of teaching has on people. Educating adults is a really unique and exciting challenge–especially continuing the journey of self-improvement and self-learning despite all the other priorities that complicate life.
