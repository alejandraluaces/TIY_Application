# About This Application

I styled this application to serve as a cover letter, resume, and a narrative, rolled into a format that resembles a program syllabus. Several of my friends work for various code schools and generously shared their own syllabi with me as I developed my own design apprenticeship syllabus.

One common theme in these public syllabus/itinerary sites is visual inconsistency. Many of the sites are unique: created and styled by individual instructors. As such, the brand voice and tone becomes lost. What I’ve made here addresses some of that: having The Iron Yard prominently displayed as the first focal point, complete with brand colors and styling I took from your marketing site.

Another issue I’ve recognized is that these documents (some even hosted solely on GitHub, not a publicly accessible URL) are made by developers, styled in a way other developers can  understand. We easily forget that these students are not yet developers! I was not always a developer and it’s taken years of practice and effort to think like one. This gives me a great deal of empathy for, and understanding of, your client base.

Additionally, since I work so closely with clients and have an apprentice of my own, I am always trying to improve the way I teach, sometimes through reading The Iron Yard recommended readings like Make it Stick.
