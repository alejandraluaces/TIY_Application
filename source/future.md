# Where I'm Going

While I love the variety and intermittent feverishness of consulting work, for my next role, I envision myself in a product company.

## Education
Most importantly, I would love to be part of an organization that values and promotes education both internally and within the community.

Educating adults is a really unique and exciting challenge. Continuing the journey of self-improvement and self-learning despite all the other priorities that complicate life is something I think about all the time, and work hard to promote to those I mentor.

## Pattern Libraries
At my next job, I really want to be able establish or maintain style guides/pattern libraries.

Such tools help maintain consistent branding, while their dynamic nature allows for evolution. It helps make code easier to maintain, and ensures the overarching brand doesn't get lost.

It also saves time. And time is money.

## Culture
Other nice-to-haves would be: values alignment amongst all employees, diverse or actively working toward diversity, and the possibility of remote work. Respect of work/life balance would be nice, too, although I'm okay with working late when crucial to the success of the project.
