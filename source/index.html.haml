    %p.moduleBio__paragraph Alejandra Luaces discovered that zookeeping required her to be outdoors too often, so she decided to make the switch to software development.


I am a wildlife biologist turned product designer. At my core, I have an insatiable hunger for knowledge, which I attempt to satiate by having lots of hobbies with a steep learning curve: espresso making, sous vide cooking, sewing, calligraphy, yoga.

Iâ€™ve also read that teaching is a great way to learn better and retain knowledge, so I stay involved in my community through Girl Develop It, and spearheading an apprenticeship program. This passion has led me to apply to be a Designer at The Iron Yard.
