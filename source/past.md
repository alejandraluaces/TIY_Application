# Where I've Been

Let’s take a step back for a second, before software. I tried my hand at getting a formal education through Santa Fe College’s Zoo Animal Technology program. There, I crammed thousands of scientific names into my head, did a lot of landscaping, and cleaned up a lot of poop.

More importantly, though–through zookeeping I learned about learning from both ends of the spectrum, by absorbing the curriculum and practically applying it, by training animals as part of the program’s requirements, and by holding collaborative study sessions with my peers.

My first foray into software design & development was when Cory Foy offered me a design apprenticeship with 8th Light, Inc. I spent nine months in their intensive program covering design fundamentals, front-end development, and user experience research. I also planned and hosted 8th Light University events which took place weekly, featured a speaker, and ended with an open-office, collaborative working session.

Since then, I’ve enjoyed my time at Table XI and Eight Bit Studios (with some freelance consulting in between), holistically addressing design for a variety of clients: from early-stage startups to well-established organizations. I’ve worked with clients like the Field Museum, International Housewares Association, Nielsen, and Charipick, to name a few.
