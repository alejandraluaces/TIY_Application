# Where I've Been

## Zookeeping

Let’s take a step back for a second, before software. I tried my hand at getting a formal education through Santa Fe College’s Zoo Animal Technology program. There, I crammed thousands of scientific names into my head, did a lot of landscaping, and cleaned up a lot of poop.

### Why it matters

During collge, I noticed that in my zoo classes, I was able to retain and recall information with a much higher rate of success by practically applying what I learned immediately after I learned it.

In math class, I spent weeks being lectured without any practical application, and would bomb the exams. No wonder.

These experiences are what got me really caring about our broken education system, and inspired me to learn more about how humans learn.

## Software
I was feeling frustrated by higher education, so I started seeking out learning opportunities in my community: attending bootstrapper breakfasts (even though I had no idea what that meant at the time), and the Tampa.rb meetup. There, I met Gavin Stark and Jason Perry, who told me about 8th Light's apprenticeship program.

My web design career started when Cory Foy offered me a design apprenticeship with 8th Light. If you're reading this, Cory: thanks for taking a chance on me! <3

### 8th Light
I spent nine months as Justin Herrick's apprentice in 8th Light's intensive design apprenticeship program in Tampa, Florida.

My experience was pretty unique in that my mentor wasn't a designer, but a developer. This gave me a really unique insights into the development process and an analytical bent that I still possess to this day. My apprenticeship was also unique in that it was remote, which forced me to teach myself, using e-mail feedback and Skype hangouts to course-correct.

The program itself covered design fundamentals, front-end development, and user experience research. I also planned and hosted 8th Light University events which took place weekly, featured a speaker, and ended with an open-office, collaborative working session.

### Freelancing
During my time freelancing, I worked mostly to establish brand kits for small, creative businesses and Etsy merchants.

I also practiced photography and did a lot of technical cooking.

## Product Design
I'm splitting my software career into two distinct sections because it was during this time that I developed a better sense of how I define myself as a designer and the niche I want to fill in this industry.

I decided at this point that design needed to be a holistic process, with visual design, development, strategy, and copy, working together as one.

### Table XI
I came on as a Designer at Table XI and touched a variety of projects for a variety of clients: from early-stage startups to well-established organizations. I did work mostly for museums (like the Field Museum, see figure above) and nonprofits.

I did print and poster design, chalk art installations, front-end development, illustration, and UX research. I helped establish the design kickoff process which was part of Table XI's 'Inception'. I also hosted Girl Develop It *Code & Coffee* meetups, where I mentored some really lovely ladies.

It was here I learned how to sell my designs, how to hold successful and informative design kickoffs, learned about SASS variable mapping, and about how to write *better* CSS.

### Eight Bit Studios

I am a product designer at Eight Bit Studios. I work on all design-related tasks: branding, copy writing, UX research, and front-end development.

I still work for a variety of clients, including behemoth organizations like Nielsen and International Housewares Association all the way down to startups like Charipick (see figure).

Recently, I introduced the concept of design kickoffs. I'm proud to say they're now a part of Eight Bit's client onboarding process and help clients feel more involved in the outcome of our engagement. Designing in the open is also discussed in the design kickoff: if the client is receptive to the idea of documenting and publicly sharing the design and development process in a public-facing medium, it's added to their statement of work/contract. I'm responsible for writing the blog posts.

My most significant achievement has been having an apprentice. I crafted a design apprenticeship syllabus complete with assignments, weekly reading, and a scheduled 1:1. I plan to open source the syllabus soon.
