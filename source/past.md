# Where I've Been

## Zookeeping

Let’s take a step back for a second, before software. I tried my hand at getting a formal education through Santa Fe College’s Zoo Animal Technology program. There, I crammed thousands of scientific names into my head, did a lot of landscaping, and cleaned up a lot of poop.

### Why it matters

Through zookeeping I learned a lot about learning. I observed that I could retain and recall with a much higher rate of success by practically applying when I learned immediately after I learned it.

In math class, I spent weeks being lectured, and would bomb the exams. No wonder.

These experiences are what got me really caring about education.

## Enter Software

My first foray into software design & development was when Cory Foy offered me a design apprenticeship with 8th Light, Inc. I spent nine months in their intensive program covering design fundamentals, front-end development, and user experience research. I also planned and hosted 8th Light University events which took place weekly, featured a speaker, and ended with an open-office, collaborative working session.

Since then, I’ve worked at Table XI and Eight Bit Studios (with some freelance consulting in between), holistically addressing design for a variety of clients: from early-stage startups to well-established organizations.

I’ve worked with clients like the Field Museum, International Housewares Association, Nielsen, and Charipick, to name a few.
